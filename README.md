To compile this program, run the following command: 
 g++ -g -Wall ulliststr.cpp ulliststr_test.cpp -o ulliststr_test

the output will be test cases. To see what each test case does, 
look at the comments in ulliststr_test.cpp. 

each test case test one scenario and/or one function. 

Valgrind works too. No errors. Trust me.
